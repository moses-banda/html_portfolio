<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Moses — a tech enthusiast, community builder, and lifelong learner with a passion for solving real-world problems through innovation. Whether it’s developing a tactile algebra board to support blind students in Zambia or building an AI-powered waste management system at a global hackathon, I’m constantly exploring the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey began with curiosity and has grown into a deep commitment to designing tools that empower others.

<p>I’m currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University, where I serve as a board member on the Student Alumni Board and contribute to campus initiatives through the Partnership Committee. From organizing alumni events and distributing tech tour tickets to helping students feel connected, I love finding ways to bridge generations through shared experiences. Outside of academics, I’ve developed public speaking skills through EducationUSA and enjoy helping others navigate their academic and career journeys.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, leading events, or geeking out over chess (yes, I even have a birthday cake shaped like a chessboard!), you’ll probably find me exploring new ideas, playing a match online, or dreaming up my next big project. I believe tech should be inclusive, purposeful, and a little bit fun — just like me.</p>
